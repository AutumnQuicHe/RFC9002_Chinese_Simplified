A Retry packet causes a client to send another Initial packet, effectively restarting the connection process. A Retry packet indicates that the Initial packet was received but not processed. A Retry packet cannot be treated as an acknowledgment because it does not indicate that a packet was processed or specify the packet number.

重试数据包使得客户端再发送一个初始数据包，能有效地重启连接的过程。重试数据包表明了初始数据包已被接收到但是没有得到处理。重试数据包不能被当作确认来对待，因为它既不表明数据包得到了处理，也没有指明数据包号。

Clients that receive a Retry packet reset congestion control and loss recovery state, including resetting any pending timers. Other connection state, in particular cryptographic handshake messages, is retained; see Section 17.2.5 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

接收到重试数据包的客户端会重置拥塞控制器和丢包恢复状态，包括重置任何进行中的计时器。其他连接状态，尤其是加密握手消息，会得到保留；详见《[QUIC传输]()》的[第17.2.5章]()。

The client MAY compute an RTT estimate to the server as the time period from when the first Initial packet was sent to when a Retry or a Version Negotiation packet is received. The client MAY use this value in place of its default for the initial RTT estimate.

客户端{{< req_level MAY >}}为服务器计算一个RTT预估，该值从首个初始数据包被发送起，至接收到重试数据包或版本协商数据包为止。客户端{{< req_level MAY >}}使用该值来作为初始RTT预估的默认值。
