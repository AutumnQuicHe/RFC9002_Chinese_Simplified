When Initial and Handshake packet protection keys are discarded (see Section 4.9 of [QUIC-TLS]), all packets that were sent with those keys can no longer be acknowledged because their acknowledgments cannot be processed. The sender MUST discard all recovery state associated with those packets and MUST remove them from the count of bytes in flight.

当初始数据包保护密钥和握手数据包保护密钥被弃用时（详见《[QUIC-TLS]()》的[第4.9章]()）所有用这些密钥发送的数据包都不再能被确认，因为对于这些数据包的确认无法得到处理。发送方{{< req_level MUST >}}丢弃所有于这些数据包相关的用于恢复的状态数据，并且{{< req_level MUST >}}将它们从在途字节计数中移除。

Endpoints stop sending and receiving Initial packets once they start exchanging Handshake packets; see Section 17.2.2.1 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT]. At this point, recovery state for all in-flight Initial packets is discarded.

终端一旦开始通信握手数据包，就会停止发送和接收初始数据包；详见《[QUIC传输]()》的[第17.2.2.1章]()。在这时，所有在途初始数据包的用于恢复的状态数据都会被丢弃。

When 0-RTT is rejected, recovery state for all in-flight 0-RTT packets is discarded.

当0-RTT被拒绝时，所有在途0-RTT数据包的用于恢复的状态数据都会被丢弃。

If a server accepts 0-RTT, but does not buffer 0-RTT packets that arrive before Initial packets, early 0-RTT packets will be declared lost, but that is expected to be infrequent.

如果服务器接受0-RTT，但是没有缓存比初始数据包更早到达的0-RTT数据包，那么提前到达的0-RTT数据包会被认定为丢包，但是这种情况不太会频繁出现。

It is expected that keys are discarded at some time after the packets encrypted with them are either acknowledged or declared lost. However, Initial and Handshake secrets are discarded as soon as Handshake and 1-RTT keys are proven to be available to both client and server; see Section 4.9.1 of [QUIC-TLS].

在用某密钥加密的数据包得到确认或被认定为丢包后一段时间后，该密钥应该被弃用。然而，在握手密钥和1-RTT密钥被认为同时对客户端和服务器可用时，初始秘密值和握手秘密值就会被弃用；详见《[QUIC-TLS]()》的[第4.9.1章]()。
