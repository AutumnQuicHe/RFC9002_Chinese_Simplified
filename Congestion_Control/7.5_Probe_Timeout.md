Probe packets MUST NOT be blocked by the congestion controller. A sender MUST however count these packets as being additionally in flight, since these packets add network load without establishing packet loss. Note that sending probe packets might cause the sender's bytes in flight to exceed the congestion window until an acknowledgment is received that establishes loss or delivery of packets.

拥塞控制器{{< req_level MUST_NOT >}}阻拦探测数据包。然而发送方{{< req_level MUST >}}将这些数据包额外计入在途字节中，因为这些数据包增加了网络负载。注意，发送探测数据包可能使得发送方的在途字节数超过拥塞窗口，直到接收到了能够确定数据包是遭遇了丢包或被送达的确认。
