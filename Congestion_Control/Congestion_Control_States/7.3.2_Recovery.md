A NewReno sender enters a recovery period when it detects the loss of a packet or when the ECN-CE count reported by its peer increases. A sender that is already in a recovery period stays in it and does not reenter it.

当检测到丢包或当由对端报告的`ECN-CE`计数增加时，使用NewReno的发送方就会进入恢复期。已经处于恢复期的发送方不会重新进入恢复期。

On entering a recovery period, a sender MUST set the slow start threshold to half the value of the congestion window when loss is detected. The congestion window MUST be set to the reduced value of the slow start threshold before exiting the recovery period.

在进入恢复期时，发送方{{< req_level MUST >}}将慢启动阈值设置为检测到丢包时的拥塞窗口大小的一半。{{< req_level MUST >}}在退出恢复期前完成此减半操作。

Implementations MAY reduce the congestion window immediately upon entering a recovery period or use other mechanisms, such as Proportional Rate Reduction [PRR], to reduce the congestion window more gradually. If the congestion window is reduced immediately, a single packet can be sent prior to reduction. This speeds up loss recovery if the data in the lost packet is retransmitted and is similar to TCP as described in Section 5 of [RFC6675].

QUIC实现{{< req_level MAY >}}在进入恢复期时立即缩小拥塞窗口，或使用其他机制，例如比例降速法（详见《[PRP]()》），来逐渐缩小拥塞窗口。如果选择立即缩小拥塞窗口，那么可以在缩小前先发送一个数据包。如《[RFC6675]()》的[第5章]()所述，如果遭遇丢包的数据包中的数据得到重传，那么这种做法能加速丢包恢复，并且与TCP中的行为一致。

The recovery period aims to limit congestion window reduction to once per round trip. Therefore, during a recovery period, the congestion window does not change in response to new losses or increases in the ECN-CE count.

恢复期的目的是将缩小拥塞窗口的频率控制在每一轮往返时间内不超过一次。因此，在恢复期中，拥塞窗口不会对新的丢包事件或ECN-CN计数的增加作出响应。

A recovery period ends and the sender enters congestion avoidance when a packet sent during the recovery period is acknowledged. This is slightly different from TCP's definition of recovery, which ends when the lost segment that started recovery is acknowledged [RFC5681].

一旦在恢复期中发送的数据包得到确认，恢复期就会结束，发送方会进入拥塞回避状态。这与TCP中对恢复的定义稍微有点区别，在后者中，恢复期是在启动恢复的那个被丢失的数据段得到确认时结束的。
