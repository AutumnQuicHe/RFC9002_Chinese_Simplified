TCP uses a minimum congestion window of one packet. However, loss of that single packet means that the sender needs to wait for a PTO to recover (Section 6.2), which can be much longer than an RTT. Sending a single ack-eliciting packet also increases the chances of incurring additional latency when a receiver delays its acknowledgment.

TCP使用的最小拥塞窗口为一个数据包。然而，如果该单个数据包遭遇丢包，那么发送方就需要等待一个PTO时间才能恢复（详见[第6.2章]()），这可能远大于单个RTT时间。当接收方有意延迟确认时，仅发送单个ACK触发包还增加了引入额外延迟的可能性。

QUIC therefore recommends that the minimum congestion window be two packets. While this increases network load, it is considered safe since the sender will still reduce its sending rate exponentially under persistent congestion (Section 6.2).

因此QUIC推荐最小拥塞窗口为两个数据包。尽管这会增加网络负载，但是因为发送方仍然会在遇到持续拥塞时以指数降低自身的发送速率，因此这种做法被认为是安全的。
