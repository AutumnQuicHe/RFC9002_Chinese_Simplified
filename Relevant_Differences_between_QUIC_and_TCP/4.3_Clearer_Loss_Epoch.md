QUIC starts a loss epoch when a packet is lost. The loss epoch ends when any packet sent after the start of the epoch is acknowledged. TCP waits for the gap in the sequence number space to be filled, and so if a segment is lost multiple times in a row, the loss epoch may not end for several round trips. Because both should reduce their congestion windows only once per epoch, QUIC will do it once for every round trip that experiences loss, while TCP may only do it once across multiple round trips.

QUIC会在数据包丢包时启动一个丢包计时器。该丢包计时器会在其启动后被发送的任一数据包得到确认时停止计时。TCP中的行为是等到序列号空间的空档被填上为止，因此当某数据段连续遭遇丢包时，丢包计时器哪怕经过数轮往返时间也不会停止。因为两者都应该在每次计时期间仅缩小一次拥塞窗口，所以QUIC会在每段遭遇丢包的往返时间内缩小一次窗口，而TCP可能要经过数段往返时间才缩小一次。
