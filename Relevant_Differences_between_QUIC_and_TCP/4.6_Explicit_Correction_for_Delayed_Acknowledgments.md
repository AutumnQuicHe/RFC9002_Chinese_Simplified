QUIC endpoints measure the delay incurred between when a packet is received and when the corresponding acknowledgment is sent, allowing a peer to maintain a more accurate RTT estimate; see Section 13.2 of [QUIC-TRANSPORT].

QUIC终端会测量在接收到数据包时和在发送相应的确认时之间的延迟，使得对端能够维护更准确的RTT预估；详见《[QUIC传输]()》的[第13.2章]()。
