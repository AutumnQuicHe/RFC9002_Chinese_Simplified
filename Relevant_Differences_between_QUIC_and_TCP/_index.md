Readers familiar with TCP's loss detection and congestion control will find algorithms here that parallel well-known TCP ones. However, protocol differences between QUIC and TCP contribute to algorithmic differences. These protocol differences are briefly described below.

熟悉TCP的丢包检测和拥塞控制的读者会发现本文中的算法与TCP中的一些知名算法类似。然而，QUIC和TCP间的协议差异会导致算法上的变化。下文简要描述了这些差异。
